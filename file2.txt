How we verified footage of fierce gun battle
A few hours ago, video emerged on social media appearing to show a gun battle taking place somewhere between the Gaza border and Ashdod in Israel. Here's how we verified it as genuine.
Hello!!!
The video was likely to have been taken recently - search engines hadn't yet indexed it, and the weather was a match for this morning.
World!!!
The video was filmed from different places and angles, suggesting multiple cameras, but it clearly depicted the same incident.

The highway from Ashdod to the Gaza border is Route 4. When viewed on satellite imagery, it's mostly a straight road with a few distinctive bends. It also passes through several built-up areas.

The road in the videos has two bends and a large undeveloped field next to it. These features suggested a section of Route 4 that could be a match.

Following Google's street view at this point enabled us to match several distinguishing features, such as trees and bushes, lamp posts and pylons, and a unique ruin structure in the field parallel to the road.
